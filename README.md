# FFA320-Saitek-Logitech-X52-Pro for X-Plane
XMLs for adapting the X52LuaOut for use with the FF A320 Ultimate
Prerequisites

1. Download and install the excellent X52LuaOut plugin for X-Plane by Mr-Man [here](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/35304-x52luaout-winmaclin/&tab=comments&page=11)

2. Confirm the default.xml provided by Mr-Man works with the stock Cessna 172 SP (Skyhawk)

3. Place the file in this repository publish.txt in the data folder of the FF A320 eg 
Desktop/X-Plane 11/Aircraft/Extra Aircraft/FlightFactor A320 ultimate/data
This exposes the internal FF A320 datarefs for AP-1, Expedite and Approach panel lights to illuminate joystick LEDs appropriately.
